            <p class="tab">The Servo Stressors are a robotics team from St. Louis, Missouri. Based at Crossroads College 
            	Preparatory School, our team includes members in grades seven through twelve. The Servo 
            	Stressors were started in 2017 at the request of Crossroads students. Every year, we 
            	compete in the First Tech Challenge. We call ourselves the Servo Stressors because we 
            	tend to rely on and overuse our servos. </p>
            <p class="tab">Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this season has been very different from previous years. 
            	The Servo Stressors never met in person as a full team this year. All communication took 
            	place over zoom and our meeting time was significantly less than in previous years. The 
            	inability to meet in person has presented many challenges, particularly relating to the 
            	robot's actual building and designing. Because of in-person restraints, we decided to 
            	repurpose most of last year's robot design and make adaptations for this year's 
            	challenge. Another challenge we faced was how to program a robot we could not physically 
            	access. Our programming team adapted by learning how to use a virtual robot simulator 
            	and share code through GitHub.</p>
            <p class="tab">Even though this year presented a multitude of challenges and changes, the Servo 
            	Stressors are proud to have produced a working robot for competition.</p>
