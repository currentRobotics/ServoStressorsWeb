         <h5>Cliff Sodergren</h5>
         <p>Hello!  My name is Cliff Sodergren and I’m a science and math teacher at Crossroads 
         	and one of the FTC Coaches of Team #13051.  I was pushed to help launch our FTC 
         	team four years ago by students eager for the opportunity.  I also enjoy basketball 
         	and the outdoors.   I have enjoyed coaching robotics because of how I get to see 
         	students take on challenges and grow while working together towards success.</p>

         <p>Hi!  My name is Sarah Tolch and I teach Science and Engineering at Crossroads.  
         	This is my fourth year working with Robotics, and I love seeing how our students 
         	use their minds and problem-solving skills in a competition setting.  Since Crossroads 
         	is a small school, the chance to make connections with other teachers and students 
         	who are also interested in Robotics is always fun.</p>

         <h5>Bryan Ammons</h5>
         <p>I’m Bryan Ammons. I’m 15 and in the 9th grade. I just joined the XRDS robotics 
         	team this year. I decided to join robotics because I’m interested in STEM 
         	activities as well as all of the aspects of the games. My primary role for the 
         	team is a member of the build/design team. This means my role is to think of 
         	ideas for the robot, implement them, and help with maintenance. In my free time, 
         	I like to try new skills and play video games. So far, I enjoy being on the 
         	team because it allows me to express my creativity in a way that is fun and engaging</p>

         <p>My name is Courtnee Martin. I'm 18 and I'm a senior. I've been on the team since the beginning, 
         	so four years. I first wanted to join the robotics team because I wanted to be an engineer. 
         	I stayed on the team because I found a love of handling the outreach. My role is that 
         	I am the head of the Outreach team. I enjoy working, painting, and track and field.</p>

         <p>My name is Elliot. I am 12 years old. and I am in 7th grade at Crossroads. This 
         	is my first year on the team and I am very excited. I like coding, building,  
         	playing video games, and engineering. I plan to work on building the robot and 
         	help with coding the robot. My favorite thing to do is code little games that 
         	I can play with my friends. It is very enjoyable to do gaming, it's just fun. 
         	I enjoy coding and building because I am a creative person and it gives me the 
         	opportunity to solve unique problems.</p>

         <!--<img id="people" src="Assets/Images/People/sam.png" width="350" height="350" alt="Sam">-->
         <p>My name is Sam Bigham. I’m 17 years old and am currently a junior at Crossroads. 
         	I started on the team when it was first started in 8th grade, and this is my 4th 
         	year on the team. I joined the robotics team because I’m interested in both robots, 
         	and programming, and the robotics team has both. Currently I am the head of the 
         	programming team, but I can also 3d print some parts to help build the robot. My 
         	favorite thing to do is soccer, but sometimes, I like playing with arduinos during 
         	my freetime. I love ftc robotics because it teaches me practical ways to use code, 
         	and it lets me discover so many fun things that people can do with robots.</p>

         <p>My name is Stella. I am 18 and a senior at Crossroads College Prep. This is my 
         	first year participating in the robotics team. I decided to join to keep myself 
         	engaged in my school's community despite not physically attending school. My job 
         	in the team is to help everyone stay organized and help document our process. My

         <p>My name is Tat and I am currently a Junior at Crossroads. This is my second year 
         	on the robotics team and my role on the team is leader of build and design. I 
         	decided to join the team because at a previous school I got some experience with 
         	robotics and I enjoyed it. I am typically an active person and don’t like to sit 
         	around. My favorite part of robotics is the satisfying feeling of finishing the 
         	robot and getting to see what you accomplished. </p>

         <h5>Zoe Gannon</h5>
         <p>My name is Zoe. I am 12 and in 7th grade. This is my first year on the team, I 
         	joined because I just find robots and things fascinating. Learning how to code and 
         	creating things that can do tasks that could potentially help people is really cool 
         	to me. I am part of the programing team.One of my favorite things to do is to 
         	longboard and paint with watercolors. I find watercolors very cool, seeing colors 
         	spread out in the water and all the layering adds lovely texture to paintings. As 
         	for longboarding, I just find it relaxing. It's a nice break from stuff. Except for 
         	when you fall. That isn't very fun.</p>
